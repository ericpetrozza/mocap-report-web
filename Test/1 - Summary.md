# **Executive Summary**

## **The Current Situation**

MOCAP's digital infrastructure no longer serves its customers, staff, or growth ambitions. The platform spans 33 regional storefronts across four brands (MOCAP, Cleartec Packaging, Beckett, and X-Treme Tape) built on a 12-year-old architecture that has accumulated significant technical debt while business needs have evolved.

The company processes approximately $3.5M in combined annual online revenue through more than 4,000 transactions, with a 70/30 split between B2B and B2C sales. Pages are 90-95% identical across regions, yet the fragmented structure creates operational load without a corresponding benefit.

Between September and December 2025, we conducted comprehensive research across behavioral analytics, competitive benchmarking, product catalog auditing, stakeholder interviews, and customer surveys. The research involved around 30 internal stakeholders spanning across leadership, sales, customer service, and international operations, as well as 26 customers from North American markets (European customer data collection is ongoing). Our discovery work draws on 16 distinct research inputs to establish a clear picture of what must change.

## **What the Research Revealed**

There are 3 interconnected problems that emerged consistently across every research input. These problems compound each other, creating a cycle of friction that affects customers, staff, and business performance.

### **Impact on Customers**

Customers cannot reliably find products, serve themselves, or don’t fully trust what they see.

**The research journey is broken.** Search fails to return results for valid part numbers and common product terms. Customers who know exactly what they need cannot find it without calling. Those exploring options encounter navigation organized by internal product codes rather than their problems or applications.

**Self-service does not exist.** There is no customer portal. Buyers cannot view negotiated pricing, check order history, track shipments, or reorder without human assistance. Every routine inquiry requires customer support via phone call or email.

**Some displayed information cannot be fully trusted.** Product images show wrong configurations. Stock displays reference incorrect warehouses. Pricing contains errors. Customers learn through experience that what they see may not reflect what they get.

### **Impact on Staff**

Staff spend their days compensating for platform failures rather than serving customers.

Customer service handles preventable inquiries (tracking requests, reorder assistance, pricing confirmations) that self-service should enable. Sales staff become order-takers rather than relationship builders. Regional teams navigate market-specific breakdowns with workarounds that consume time and attention.

### **Impact on Business**

Platform dysfunction constrains growth and blocks market access.

The product page's high bounce rate reflects customers who arrive with intent and leave without action. Some call and convert anyway; others may opt for competitors with more functional websites. International markets face acute failures: checkout flows misaligned with local expectations, inventory displays showing wrong warehouse data, and freight quotes that don't match actual charges.

The fragmented architecture makes ongoing site maintenance difficult and time-consuming. Every update must be manually repeated across domains. Every fix must be applied repeatedly. The time staff spend on workarounds only scales with the number of transactions.

### **The Compounding Effect**

These problems reinforce each other. Search failure drives phone calls. No portal means every call requires manual lookup. Data inaccuracy means orders fail even when customers navigate the broken journey. The research revealed not three separate problems, but an entire system with room for improvement across every touchpoint.

## **What Customers and Competitors Show**

**Customer priorities** confirm internal observations. When forced to choose their top factors for selecting suppliers, shipping speed and stock availability led at 69%, followed by pricing at 58%, then website experience at 46%. Website quality matters to nearly half of customers, enough to justify investment, while traditional procurement factors still dominate.

**Competitor analysis** of 14 B2B industrial plastics companies reveals a market separating into transactional, consultative, and hybrid self-serve positions. The successful hybrid competitors share common patterns: navigation organized by use case, interactive filterable tables, sampling integrated into the cart flow, stock visibility at decision points, and multiple navigation paths for different buyer types. MOCAP currently executes neither the transactional nor consultative model well. The hybrid position aligns best with MOCAP's product complexity and customer expectations.

## **The Path Forward**

Research findings point to clear priorities.

**Fix the fundamentals first.** Search, customer accounts, and data accuracy represent the minimum viable scope for meaningful improvement. These dysfunctions block everything else.

**Build on a solid foundation.** Navigation serving multiple buyer archetypes, mobile-friendly reference tools, and streamlined checkout create the platform customers expect.

**Then differentiate.** Advanced discovery tools, AI-powered guidance, and sophisticated configuration capabilities create a competitive advantage once fundamentals work.

**Platform consolidation has support but carries execution risk.** 73% of surveyed customers expressed support or openness to a unified platform. However, the 27% who conditionally support consolidation identify the real challenge: success depends on thoughtful implementation, not just technical migration.

## **What Success Looks Like**

The redesigned website should enable customers to find products without calling, purchase without friction, and trust that the displayed information reflects reality. Staff should focus on complex customer needs rather than compensating for system failures. The website should feel modern without abandoning the sophistication that industrial B2B purchasing requires.

The goal of this research is to provide clear direction. What follows is execution.

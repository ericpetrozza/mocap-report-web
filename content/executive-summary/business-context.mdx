## The Current Technical Reality

### Infrastructure
- 12+ year old custom Ajax CMS plus Magento 2
- Not mobile-friendly
- 31 regional domains creating fragmentation
- Three separate ERPs: Sage Fox Pro (32-bit, no API), EFACs (cloud XML-based), KingDee (China)

### Product Complexity
- Around 180 size chart column types
- Individual products with 320+ variants
- Kit items with dependencies
- Four-decimal pricing requirements

### Analytics Breakdown
- 100% cross-domain attribution failure
- No enhanced ecommerce tracking
- Search tracking completely broken
- Can't measure what matters

### Revenue Stats
- MOCAP main site: $2.5M revenue, 6,305 transactions
- 77% cart abandonment rate
- ~15 sample requests daily
- 70 manual orders processed daily by four-person CS team

## Regional Variations That Matter

### United States
- Mix of phone orders (Kate's team handles 70 daily) and online self-service
- Desktop-led (72%) but mobile is approaching one-third of traffic
- Returning buyers want speed, new buyers need education

### Europe (UK/EU/Poland)
- Website is the primary customer acquisition channel
- 40-50% order cancellations due to data accuracy issues
- Recent warehouse shift (UK to Poland) poorly communicated
- Same-day shipping critical for special pricing customers

### Mexico
- Bridge role to US warehouse
- Cross-border complexity
- Consultative sales model
- Portal is essential for workload reduction

### China
- Zero online orders despite $3.2M+ combined Taobao/Alibaba revenue
- Relationship-based model dominates
- Cultural expectation for precision search
- KingDee ERP is separate from US systems

## Strategic Imperatives Driving This Project

**From the Global Sales Director:**
> "Critical to meet the company's 2030 goal. Failure to deliver would jeopardize multiple other strategies."

The website must transition from operational burden to revenue driver. Current state forces manual workarounds. New state must enable:

- Thousands of small accounts to self-serve profitably
- Sales team focus on large account acquisition
- 24/7 customer access to order information
- Speed advantage for negotiated pricing customers
- Foundation for international expansion

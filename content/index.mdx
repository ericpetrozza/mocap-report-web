## The Three Universal Failures

28 stakeholders across leadership and frontline roles identified three critical failures with remarkable consistency. These aren't feature requests. They're breakdowns that actively block revenue and erode customer trust.

### Search Dysfunction
**68% of stakeholders mentioned this.** The current search returns zero results for valid part numbers. Customers abandon the site and call instead. Sales reps field 15+ search-help calls daily. The system shows a 100% error rate in logs. IT estimates fixing this could drive a **20-25% sales increase**.

### Customer Portal Gap
**68% of stakeholders mentioned this.** The absence of basic self-service drives 50%+ of all customer service calls. People want order status, tracking numbers, invoices. The Global Sales Director calls this "critical to 2030 goals."

### Data Accuracy Crisis
**64% of stakeholders mentioned this.** Europe sees 40-50% order cancellations due to incorrect stock information. ERP sync delays range from two weeks to three months. One product took 13 months to appear after launch.

## What Stakeholders Want

Out of 900+ feature ratings from 24 stakeholders, five features emerged with 80-100% consensus:

| Feature | Consensus | Impact |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Customer Portal | 100% | 50%+ CS call reduction |
| Multi-Mode Smart Search | 91% | 20-25% revenue potential |
| Real-Time Stock Visibility | 74% | 40-50% European cancellation recovery |
| Logged-In Negotiated Pricing | 91% | Unlocks repeat buyer self-service |
| Customer Carrier Accounts | 80% | Eliminates shipping barriers |

Every top-rated feature serves one goal: **enable self-service instead of forcing customer contact**.

## The Path Forward

The research reveals a clear priority structure:

**Phase 0: Foundation**
Fix data quality before building features. Force decisions on brand architecture, regional rollout, MVP scope. No development until these are resolved.

**Phase 1: US MVP**
Launch with five critical features: portal, search, stock, pricing, carrier accounts. Prove the foundation works. Add two strategic features: interactive tables, multi-path navigation.

**Phase 2: Enhancement**
Add Cleartec and Beckett catalogs. Build configurators. Deploy Tier 2 features based on usage data.

**Phase 3: International**
Roll out VAT handling, warehouse selection, translation, regional payment methods.

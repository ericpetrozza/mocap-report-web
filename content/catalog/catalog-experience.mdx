# Catalog Experience

## Catalog Clarity & Mental Models

Users interact with product catalogs expecting behaviors learned from spreadsheets, Amazon, and industrial supplier sites. The current MOCAP experience violates these expectations at every turn.

### The Four Brand Realities

Each brand operates with different catalog logic, different product complexity, and different user expectations:

| Brand | Scale | Complexity | Primary User Mental Model |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------------------|
| **MOCAP** | 85 series, 2,195 SKUs, ~66K variants | Extreme (320+ variants per product) | "Show me all sizes in a table" |
| **Cleartec** | 21 series, 328 SKUs | Moderate (configurator-dependent) | "Help me build what I need" |
| **Beckett** | 18 series, 440 SKUs | Moderate (tool-specific) | "I need protection for this tool type" |
| **X-Treme Tape** | 3 types, 24 SKUs | Simple (color/size matrix) | "Which color for my application?" |

Different scales demand different approaches.

### The Data Quality Crisis (By Brand)

Before discussing catalog experience, acknowledge what research revealed: the data foundation is broken.

**MOCAP (Flagship):**
- Only 46% mention product benefits
- Inconsistent format across series
- 46 series contain "Plug"
- 28 series contain "Cap"
- Flat list (no hierarchy)

**Cleartec:**
- 62% missing material specifications
- 76% missing ID/OD dimensions
- No closure compatibility matrix
- But 94.8% have packaging quantities

**Beckett:**
- 100% empty product descriptions
- 100% empty typical applications
- 67% missing material specs
- **This is catastrophic. Can't launch catalog features with this data quality.**

**X-Treme Tape:**
- 83.3% complete dimensional data
- Clear SKU logic (width × length × color)
- Color usage guidance missing

**Implication:** Data audit is Phase 0. Writing 440 Beckett descriptions, completing 62% of Cleartec materials, enriching 54% of MOCAP descriptions. This isn't optional.

## User Behavior: Tables as Tools

Users don't view product tables as static displays. They interact expecting spreadsheet behavior:

### User Actions on Tables (Observed)

| Action | Result | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Click column headers expecting sort | 11.6% dead clicks | Frustration when nothing happens |
| Click filter dropdowns expecting refinement | 4.3% rage clicks | Abandon when can't narrow |
| Type in search expecting table filter | No search within table exists | Leave for global search |
| Tap "Add to Cart" expecting inline action | Page reload required | Extra friction on mobile |

**Quantified impact:**
- 48-54% of all clicks happen on product tables
- MOCAP: 3,257 clicks total, 1,749 on table (53.7%)
- Cleartec: 1,388 clicks total, 667 on table (48.1%)
- Beckett: 1,157 clicks total, 626 on table (54.1%)

Tables are THE primary interaction point. Yet they're completely static.

### Mental Model: "I Know What I'm Looking For"

Veterans arrive with specifications. They scan tables looking for exact match:

**MOCAP User (Thread Protection):**
```
Mental process:
  "I need 3/4-inch NPT thread protector, vinyl, red"

Expects to:
  1. Land on vinyl caps category page
  2. See table with ALL variants visible
  3. Filter or sort to narrow
  4. Identify exact SKU
  5. Add to cart from table

Current reality:
  1. Land on category page ✓
  2. See static HTML table ✗
  3. Can't filter, can't sort ✗
  4. Must read through entire list ✗
  5. Click through to separate page ✗
```

**Competitor comparison:** Caplugs provides this. Sortable table, inline cart, stock indicators. Veterans complete purchase in 2 minutes. MOCAP forces 5-10 minutes of manual scanning, or user calls CS.

### Mental Model: "Help Me Figure This Out"

Problem Solvers arrive knowing application, not specifications:

**Cleartec User (Retail Packaging):**
```
Mental process:
  "I'm packaging candles, 2.5" diameter,
   need clear tube with end caps"

Expects:
  1. Start with product category (tubes)
  2. Enter known dimension (2.5" diameter)
  3. See compatible options
  4. Guided through cap selection
  5. Visual preview of assembly

Current reality:
  1. Category page exists ✓
  2. Configurator present BUT ✗
     - 10-20 second hesitation before use
     - Unclear what each dropdown controls
     - No visual preview
     - No cap compatibility suggestions
  3. User uncertain if selection correct
```

## Size Charts, Filters & Variant Logic

### The Variant Complexity Challenge

MOCAP's scale creates unique UX challenges. Some products have 320+ variants.

**Example: Round Vinyl Caps (RVC Series)**
```
Dimensions that vary:
  - Inside Diameter (ID): 1/8" to 6"
  - Outside Diameter (OD): Calculated based on wall thickness
  - Length: 1/4" to 8"
  - Wall Thickness: Standard, Heavy, Extra Heavy
  - Color: Red, Black, Blue, Yellow, Natural, Custom
  - Features: Pull Tab (yes/no), Flanged (yes/no)
  - Temperature Rating: Standard (180°F), High-Temp (250°F), Silicone (500°F)
  - Certifications: FDA (yes/no), RoHS (yes/no)

Total combinations: 320+ distinct SKUs in single series
```

**Current display:** Flat table with 320 rows. Scroll for days.
**User expectation:** Filter to relevant subset in seconds.

### Intelligent Filtering Strategy

Filters must mirror how users think about selection:

**Priority 1 Filters (Always Visible):**

| Brand | Filter Set |
|-------|------------|
| MOCAP | Size Range, Material, Temperature, Color (swatches) |
| Cleartec | Diameter (slider), Length (input), End Cap Style, Material |
| Beckett | Tool Type (radio), Tool Diameter, Tool Length, Material Features |

**Priority 2 Filters (Collapsed by Default):**
Thread Type, Certifications (FDA, RoHS, REACH), Features (Pull Tab, Flanged, Vented), Stock Status, Min Order Quantity

### Filter UX Patterns That Work

**Real-time Results Count:**
```
FILTERS
├─ Size Range
│  ○ 1/4" (43 products)
│  ○ 1/2" (67 products)
│  ● 3/4" (52 products) [SELECTED]
│  ○ 1" (89 products)
│
├─ Material
│  ☑ Vinyl (52 products)
│  ☐ Silicone (0 products) [GREYED OUT]
│  ☐ LDPE (23 products)
│
└─ Showing 52 of 320 variants
   [Clear All Filters]
```

Key UX elements:
- Live count per option (transparency)
- Disable unavailable combinations (prevent zero results)
- Multi-select within category
- Visual feedback on active filters
- One-click reset

### Mobile Filter Strategy

Tables don't work on mobile. 320-row tables definitely don't.

**Mobile pattern:**
```
[Filters] [Sort By: Relevance ▼] [Grid/List toggle]

Tapping [Filters] opens drawer with:
- Collapsible filter categories
- Live product count
- [Clear All] [Apply Filters] buttons

Results display as cards, not tables.
```

### Variant Logic: When to Show What

| Product Size | Display Strategy |
|--------------|------------------|
| Simple (24 variants or fewer) | Show all in single table |
| Medium (25-100 variants) | Show all with collapsible sections |
| Complex (100+ variants) | Default to filtered view |
| Hyper-Complex (320+ variants) | Force progressive selection |

## Cross-Brand Catalog Consistency

Four brands with different products need consistency without uniformity.

### Universal Elements (All Brands)

**Stock Indicators:**
```
● In Stock (15,000 available)
● Low Stock (< 500 remaining)
◐ Limited Stock (500-2,000)
○ Out of Stock (2-3 weeks)
○ Made to Order (4-6 weeks)
```

**Pricing Display:**
```
List Price: $0.125 ea
Your Price: $0.108 ea (logged in)

Quantity breaks:
  1,000-4,999:  $0.108 ea
  5,000-9,999:  $0.102 ea
  10,000+:      $0.095 ea
```

**Action Buttons:**
```
Primary: [Add to Cart]
Secondary: [Request Sample] [Get Quote]
Tertiary: [Compare] [Save] [Share]
```

### Brand-Specific Patterns

**MOCAP: Variant Tables**
- Emphasis: Show all options at once
- Pattern: Expandable table with heavy filtering
- Technical buyers want comprehensive view

**Cleartec: Configurators**
- Emphasis: Guided dimensional selection
- Pattern: Step-based wizard with preview
- Design buyers want guidance, not overwhelming choice

**Beckett: Tool-Type Filtering**
- Emphasis: Browse by tool category
- Pattern: Category cards → Dimensional input
- Tool managers think in tool types first, dimensions second

**X-Treme Tape: Application Focus**
- Emphasis: Problem/solution matching
- Pattern: Application cards → Product recommendations
- Problem-first navigation. Product second.

### Configurator UX Patterns (Cleartec Focus)

Current configurator causes 10-20 second hesitation. Users unsure what each dropdown controls.

**Problem:**
```
Configure Your Item
[Select Option ▼]  [Select Option ▼]  [Select Option ▼]  [Select Option ▼]

No context. No guidance. User paralyzed.
```

**Solution: Stepped Approach**
```
Step 1 of 4: Choose Tube Diameter

We'll walk you through building your perfect tube.

What inside diameter do you need?
  ○ 1/2"     ○ 3/4"     ○ 1"
  ○ 1.25"    ● 1.5"     ○ 2"
  ○ Other: [____] in

Why this matters:
Inside diameter determines what fits inside your tube.
Measure your product and add 1/8" clearance.

[Visual: Tube cross-section showing ID measurement]

[← Back] [Continue to Length →]
```

**Key UX improvements:**
1. One decision per step (reduces cognitive load)
2. Clear "Why this matters" explanation
3. Visual preview shows impact of each choice
4. Progress indicator (Step X of Y)
5. Back navigation allows revision
6. Running configuration summary
7. Price updates with each step

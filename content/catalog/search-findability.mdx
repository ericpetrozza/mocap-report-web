# Search & Findability

## Search Behavior

### The Current Failure State

Search isn't just broken. It's catastrophically dysfunctional:

```
SEARCH LOG ANALYSIS (1,000 QUERIES)

Error Rate:        100% (999 of 1,000 return 401 error)
Zero Results:      85.7% (857 of 1,000 queries)
Average Latency:   1.28 seconds (too slow)
Slow Queries:      59% take >1 second

Sites Most Affected:
  mocap.com:              359 failed searches
  mocap.co.uk:            168 failed searches
  cleartecpackaging.com:  115 failed searches
  mocap-france.com:       103 failed searches
```

**This isn't a bug. This is a complete system failure.**

Stakeholder impact:
- 15+ calls daily per CS rep just for search help
- 20-25% sales increase potential from fixing
- 68% of stakeholders mentioned this unprompted
- #2 priority feature with 91% consensus

### Query Pattern Analysis

What users actually search for (even though nothing works):

**Part Number Queries (30% of attempts):**
```
RVC9044
FCB0375NA1
XTR2036B
CLET125-12

User expectation: Instant exact match
Current result: 401 error or zero results
Required behavior: Direct to product page
```

**Dimensional Queries (25% of attempts):**
```
3 inch cap
1/4 tube
3/4 npt plug
2.5 diameter

User expectation: Products matching dimension
Current result: Zero results
Required behavior: Parse dimension, show matches
```

**Application Queries (20% of attempts):**
```
powder coating masking
thread protection
furniture leg caps
hydraulic fitting covers

User expectation: Products for that use case
Current result: Zero results
Required behavior: Application landing page + products
```

**Material Queries (15% of attempts):**
```
silicone plugs
vinyl caps
high temp
fda approved

User expectation: Filter by material/property
Current result: Zero results
Required behavior: Material-filtered results
```

**Competitor Cross-Reference (10% of attempts):**
```
caplugs 123-456
equivalent to [competitor part]

User expectation: MOCAP equivalent identified
Current result: Zero results
Required behavior: Cross-reference database match
```

Six distinct search modes required. Current system supports zero.

### Mental Models: How Users Search

**Veteran Buyer (Knows exact part):**
```
Behavior: Types SKU, expects instant result

Search: "RVC9044"

Mental model:
  "I ordered this before"
  "I have the part number"
  "Just show me the product"

Tolerance for error: ZERO
  → If search fails, calls CS immediately
  → Or goes to competitor site
```

**Problem Solver (Knows dimensions):**
```
Behavior: Describes size in natural language

Search: "3 inch vinyl cap red"

Mental model:
  "I know what size I need"
  "I have some preference for material/color"
  "Show me options that fit"

Tolerance for error: LOW
  → Will try 2-3 search variations
  → Then calls CS or abandons
```

**Explorer (Knows application):**
```
Behavior: Describes use case

Search: "protect threads during painting"

Mental model:
  "I have a problem to solve"
  "What products work for this?"
  "Educate me on options"

Tolerance for error: MODERATE
  → Will browse after failed search
  → But expects search to shortcut to answer
```

**Novice (Uncertain terminology):**
```
Behavior: Uses general terms

Search: "cap" or "plug" or "tube"

Mental model:
  "I think I need something like this"
  "Not sure of exact product type"
  "Need guidance"

Tolerance for error: HIGH
  → Expects zero results for vague query
  → But needs helpful suggestions
```

Different users, different search strategies, all currently fail.

## Filtering & Discovery

Search gets users to results. Filters narrow those results to the right product.

### Faceted Search Architecture

Post-search filtering is as important as search itself:

**Search Results Page Structure:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Search: "vinyl caps"]                      [Search]   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└──────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Left sidebar: Filters (collapsible on mobile)
Right main: Results grid with inline actions

### Filter Priority by Product Category

Not all filters matter for all searches:

**Caps & Plugs (MOCAP):**
```
Priority 1: Size, Material, Temperature
Priority 2: Color, Thread Type, Features
Priority 3: Certifications, Stock Status
```

**Tubes & Closures (Cleartec):**
```
Priority 1: Diameter, Length, Material
Priority 2: Wall Thickness, Cap Compatibility
Priority 3: Color, Printing Options
```

**Tool Protection (Beckett):**
```
Priority 1: Tool Type, Tool Diameter
Priority 2: Material Features (foam, coolant-safe)
Priority 3: Length Range, Telescopic
```

**Tape (X-Treme):**
```
Priority 1: Application Type, Temperature Rating
Priority 2: Width, Color
Priority 3: Length (only 2 options anyway)
```

Context-sensitive filtering. Show relevant options first.

### Smart Filter Behavior

Filters should guide users toward success, not zero results:

**Real-Time Result Count:**
```
Size
□ 1/4" (23)
□ 1/2" (67)
□ 3/4" (52)
□ 1" (89)

User can see: "If I select 1/2", I'll get 67 results"
Prevents zero-result selections
```

**Disable Invalid Combinations:**
```
Material
☑ Vinyl (284)
☐ Silicone (0) [GREYED OUT]

If no silicone in current result set, grey out option
Don't allow user to select dead-end filters
```

**Progressive Narrowing:**
```
Initial: 284 vinyl caps

Select Size: 3/4" → 52 results
Select Color: Red → 12 results
Select Feature: Pull Tab → 3 results

Active filters always visible:
[3/4" ×] [Red ×] [Pull Tab ×] [Clear All]
```

**Applied Filter Feedback:**
```
Showing 3 of 284 vinyl caps

To see more results:
  • Remove [Pull Tab ×] filter (+9 more)
  • Remove [Red ×] filter (+40 more)
  • Remove [3/4" ×] filter (+232 more)

Guides user toward more results if too narrow
```

### Zero-Results Handling

Searches that return nothing shouldn't dead-end:

**Zero Results Page:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ No results found for "xyz12345"                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SUGGESTIONS:                                       │
│                                                    │
│ 1. Check your part number                         │
│    • Remove spaces or hyphens                     │
│    • Try searching without color suffix           │
│    • Example: "XYZ12345R" → "XYZ12345"           │
│                                                    │
│ 2. Search by dimensions instead                    │
│    [What size do you need?] [Search]              │
│                                                    │
│ 3. Browse by application                          │
│    [Thread Protection] [Powder Coating]           │
│    [Tube Packaging] [Tool Protection]             │
│                                                    │
│ 4. Get help from specialist                       │
│    Phone: (555-0100) or [Start Live Chat]         │
│                                                    │
│ RELATED PRODUCTS:                                  │
│ [Products from similar categories...]             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Never abandon user on blank page. Always provide next steps.

### Synonym Handling

Users describe products differently than database categorizes them:

**Synonym Mapping Required:**
```
User search → Database term

"cap"           → "cap", "cover", "protector"
"plug"          → "plug", "cap" (yes, overlap)
"protector"     → "cap", "plug", "cover"
"masking"       → "high-temp cap", "powder coating"
"thread cover"  → "threaded cap", "NPT cap"
"end cap"       → "tube cap", "closure"
"tape"          → "masking tape", "self-fusing tape"
```

Some terms are completely interchangeable in industry. System must know this.

**Competitor terms:**
```
User searches: "Caplugs style cap"
System understands: Show MOCAP equivalent products

User searches: "Fastenal 1234"
System: Check cross-reference database
```

**Misspellings:**
```
"vynil" → "vinyl"
"selicone" → "silicone"
"powercoating" → "powder coating"

Fuzzy matching within 1-2 characters
```

### Autocomplete Intelligence

Search box should assist, not just receive input:

**Autocomplete Behavior:**
```
User types: "3 i"

Dropdown appears:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔍 3 inch cap                          │
│ 🔍 3 inch tube                         │
│ 🔍 3 inch plug                         │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📦 RVC3000 - 3" Round Vinyl Cap       │
│ 📦 FCB3000 - 3" Tapered Plug          │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📄 Thread Protection for 3" Fittings  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Suggests:
  - Query completions (top)
  - Direct product matches (middle)
  - Content pages (bottom)

Keyboard navigable
Click or Enter to select
```

**Smart Suggestions:**
```
For part numbers: Show exact match FIRST
  User: "RVC"
  Top result: "RVC Series - Round Vinyl Caps"

For dimensions: Parse and suggest
  User: "3/4"
  Top results: "3/4 inch caps", "3/4 inch plugs"

For applications: Suggest landing pages
  User: "powder"
  Top results: "Powder Coating Masking Solutions"
```

Autocomplete reduces typing, guides intent, prevents errors.

### Search History & Saved Searches (Logged-In Users)

Repeat buyers often search for same products:

**Search History:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ YOUR RECENT SEARCHES                   │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🕐 RVC9044 (2 hours ago)              │

## UX Recommendations

### Replace Custom Search with Native Elasticsearch

Current custom search is the root problem. It's:
- Poorly maintained
- Disconnected from product data
- Returning 100% errors
- Too slow (1.28s average)

**Solution:** Use Magento native Elasticsearch

Benefits:
- Built-in synonym support
- Auto-complete included
- Fast indexing
- Regular updates
- Native integration with catalog

Technical implementation outside this document's scope, but UX recommendation is clear: **abandon custom code, use proven platform tool**.

### Six Search Modes Implementation

System must recognize query type and respond appropriately:

**Mode 1: Exact Part Number**
```
Query: RVC9044
Recognition: Alphanumeric, matches SKU pattern
Response: Direct to product page (no results page)
Fallback: "Did you mean RVC0944?" if not found
```

**Mode 2: Dimensional**
```
Query: 3 inch cap
Recognition: Contains number + unit + product type
Response: Parse dimension → Filter products → Results page
Display: "Showing caps with 3" inside diameter"
```

**Mode 3: Application**
```
Query: powder coating masking
Recognition: Contains application keyword
Response: Application landing page + filtered products
Display: "Powder Coating Protection Solutions"
```

**Mode 4: Material/Property**
```
Query: FDA approved silicone
Recognition: Contains material/certification keywords
Response: Filter by attributes → Results page
Display: "FDA-approved silicone products"
```

**Mode 5: Competitor Cross-Reference**
```
Query: Caplugs 123-456
Recognition: Contains competitor name + part number
Response: Cross-reference database lookup → Equivalent
Display: "MOCAP equivalent: RVC9044"
```

**Mode 6: Natural Language**
```
Query: what protects 1/2 inch threads during painting
Recognition: Full sentence structure
Response: Intent parsing → Application match → Products
Display: "Thread protection for 1/2" during painting"
```

Each mode requires different backend logic, but user shouldn't think about modes. System adapts to query type automatically.

### Search Box Placement

Search is #2 priority feature. Placement must reflect importance:

**Desktop:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MOCAP                                            │
│                                                  │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐  Cart │
│ │ 🔍 Search products, part numbers... │   (3) │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                                  │
│ Products | Applications | Industries | Support  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Prominent in header. Visible on every page. Can't miss it.

**Mobile:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☰  MOCAP                    🔍 🛒│
│                                  │
│ Tapping 🔍 expands search:       │
│                                  │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────┐│
│ │ 🔍 Search...              [×]││
│ └──────────────────────────────┘│
│                                  │
│ [Recent: RVC9044]                │
│ [Recent: 3/4 cap]                │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Search icon in header. Expands to full-width input. Shows recent searches.

**Alternative: Persistent Search Bar**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌──────────────────────────────┐│
│ │ 🔍 Search...                 ││
│ └──────────────────────────────┘│
│ ☰                           🛒 │
│ MOCAP                      Cart │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Search bar above logo on mobile. Always visible. No tap to reveal.

User testing will determine best mobile pattern, but search must be immediately accessible.

### Search Analytics & Continuous Improvement

Search isn't "done" after launch. Requires ongoing optimization:

**Track Metrics:**
```
Success Rate:
  % of searches leading to product view
  % of searches leading to add-to-cart
  % of searches leading to purchase

Failure Indicators:
  % zero-result searches
  % refined searches (user tried multiple queries)
  % searches followed by site exit

Query Analysis:
  Most common queries
  Queries with zero results
  Queries with low click-through
  Queries with high bounce
```

**Monthly Review Process:**
```
1. Identify top 50 zero-result queries
2. Determine if:
   a) Product doesn't exist (can't fix)
   b) Synonym missing (add to dictionary)
   c) Data enrichment needed (add keywords)
   d) Query parsing failed (improve algorithm)
3. Implement fixes
4. Measure improvement
```

**Synonym Dictionary Growth:**
```
Start with 100-200 common synonyms
Add 10-20 per month based on real queries
Example:
  Month 1: User searches "high heat cap"
          → Zero results
          → Add synonym: "high heat" → "high temperature"
  Month 2: Query now succeeds
```

Search improves over time through data-driven refinement.

### Search Results Best Practices

How results display matters as much as which results return:

**Result Card Design:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Product Image]                    │
│                                    │
│ RVC0750R                          │
│ 3/4" Round Vinyl Cap, Red         │
│                                    │
│ ● In Stock (15,000)               │
│ $0.125 ea (1,000+)                │
│                                    │

│ Pull tab available                 │
│                                    │
│ [🛒 Add to Cart] [📋 Sample]      │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key info visible without click:
- SKU and description
- Stock status
- Pricing (if logged in)
- Key differentiators
- Actions inline

**Relevance Ranking:**
```
Priority 1: Exact SKU match
Priority 2: Exact dimension match
Priority 3: Close dimension match
Priority 4: Application relevance
Priority 5: Material/property match
Priority 6: Related products
```

Most relevant first. User finds answer quickly.

**Visual Highlighting:**
```
Search query: "3/4 red vinyl"

Result displays with highlights:
3/4" Round Vinyl Cap, Red
     ^^^^      ^^^^^     ^^^

Query terms highlighted in results
User sees why result matched
```

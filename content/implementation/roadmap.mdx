# Roadmap

**PRIORITY ORDER ONLY** (No dates or time ranges)

This roadmap is sequenced by dependencies, risk, and strategic value. Each phase builds on the previous. Timing will depend on platform selection, resource availability, and blocking decisions.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Must Complete Before Development)

These aren't features. They're decisions and data fixes that block everything else.

### Critical Blocking Decisions

**Decision 1: Brand Architecture**
```
Options:
  A. Complete separation (3-4 independent sites)
  B. Full consolidation (single unified site)
  C. Hybrid platform (shared backend, brand experiences)

Recommendation: Option C (Hybrid with brand subdomains)

Why blocking: URL structure, navigation design,
             analytics setup all depend on this

Decision deadline: Must resolve before any design work
```

**Decision 2: Regional Rollout Strategy**
```
Options:
  A. US-first launch, then international
  B. Simultaneous global launch
  C. Priority market launch (US + UK), then expand

Recommendation: Option A (US-first to prove foundation)

Why blocking: Impacts MVP scope, translation requirements,
            warehouse integration, payment gateways

Tradeoff: US-first = Europe pain continues temporarily
         BUT simpler MVP, faster to market, prove value
```

**Decision 3: Sample Request Policy**
```
Current: No clear policy, inconsistent limits

Questions requiring answers:
  - Limit per customer per period?
  - Limit per product type?
  - Approval workflow required?
  - First-time vs. repeat customer differences?
  - Shipping costs (customer pays? free?)?

Recommendation: 5 samples per product series per month,
              free shipping, auto-approve for registered customers

Why blocking: Can't build sample feature without policy
```

**Decision 4: Platform Selection**
```
Options being evaluated:
  A. Magento 2 (current, but requires major customization)
  B. BigCommerce B2B
  C. Shopify Plus (eliminated - 4 decimal pricing issue)
  D. Custom build

Requirements:
  - 320+ variants per product
  - 4-decimal pricing ($0.1234/ea)
  - Kit items with dependencies
  - Tiered pricing by customer
  - 3 ERP integrations
  - Regional pricing/currency
  - Carrier account integration

Recommendation: Evaluate BigCommerce B2B vs Magento 2

Why blocking: All technical design depends on platform
            capabilities and constraints
```

**Decision 5: MVP Scope Lock**
```
Stakeholders want 50+ features
Budget/timeline allows 5-7

Must formally agree on:
  - Tier 1 (launch blockers): 5 features
  - Tier 2 (nice-to-have): 2 features
  - Everything else (Phase 1+ or later)

Get signed agreement from leadership
Lock scope to prevent creep

Why blocking: Without scope discipline, project extends
            indefinitely and nothing launches
```

### Data Quality Foundation (Critical Path)

**Data Audit**
```
Audit scope:
  ✓ Completeness (missing descriptions, specs, dimensions)
  ✓ Accuracy (ERP sync validation)
  ✓ Consistency (format standardization)
  ✓ Enrichment opportunities (applications, benefits)

Output: Spreadsheet identifying gaps by severity

Beckett priorities:
  - 440 product descriptions (100% empty)
  - 440 application fields (100% empty)
  - 67% material specs missing

Cleartec priorities:
  - 62% material specs missing
  - 76% ID/OD dimensions missing
  - Closure compatibility matrix creation

MOCAP priorities:
  - 54% descriptions lack benefits
  - Thread spec completion
  - Application context addition

X-Treme priorities:
  - Color usage guidance
  - Application expansion
  - Comparison content
```

**Data Remediation**
```
Writing priorities:
  1. Beckett (440 descriptions from scratch)
  2. MOCAP benefit statements (1,200+ to enhance)
  3. Cleartec specs completion (200+ records)
  4. Application context (all brands)

Format: [What + Does + Where + Why + How]

Resources required:
  - Product managers (subject matter experts)
  - Technical writer (consistency)
  - Copywriter (benefit-focused language)
  - Data entry (bulk updates)

Validation:
  - Random sample review (10% of each brand)
  - Stakeholder approval
  - Final ERP upload
```

**Ongoing: Data Governance Standards**
```
Establish process for future:
  - New product template (required fields)
  - Approval workflow before ERP entry
  - Regular audit schedule (quarterly)
  - Responsibility assignment (who owns what)

Without governance, data degrades again
This is foundation for long-term success
```

### Analytics Implementation

**GA4 Rebuild**
```
Current state: Broken cross-domain tracking,
             no enhanced ecommerce,
             search tracking dead

New implementation:
  ✓ Single GA4 property (all brands)
  ✓ Brand dimension (filter by brand)
  ✓ Enhanced ecommerce (full funnel)
  ✓ Search tracking (queries, results, clicks)
  ✓ Custom events (samples, configurators, filters)
  ✓ User ID tracking (logged-in customers)

Backup: BigQuery export (raw data retention)

Test thoroughly before launch
Can't optimize what can't measure
```

# Content Design & Messaging

## Clarity & Trust Guidelines

Content must serve two main things: clarity for new users, efficiency for returning customers. Balance technical precision with accessible language.

### Universal Content Principles (All Brands)

**1. Scannable Structure**
```
Use visual hierarchy:
  H2: Category headers
  H3: Subsections
  Bullets: Lists of features/specs
  Bold: Key specifications

Avoid:
  Long unbroken paragraphs
  Wall-of-text descriptions
  Buried call-to-actions
```

**2. Benefits Before Features**
```
Good: "Protects threads during powder coating up to 400°F"
Bad:  "Temperature rating: 400°F continuous"

Lead with what it does for the user
Support with technical specification
```

**3. Stock Status Transparency**
```
Honest > Optimistic

✓ In Stock (15,000 available) - Ships today
✓ Low Stock (247 remaining) - Order soon
✓ Out of Stock - Back in stock Dec 15
✓ Made to Order - 4-6 week lead time

Never show stock if data is stale (>15 min)
Never promise dates if uncertain
```

**4. Pricing Clarity**
```
Public pricing:
  List Price: $0.125 ea (1,000+)
  Volume pricing available

Logged-in pricing:
  Your Price: $0.108 ea
  (Contract pricing through Dec 2026)

No surprises at checkout
```

**5. Trust Signals Throughout**
```
Product pages:
  - ISO 9001 certified
  - Made in USA (where applicable)
  - RoHS compliant
  - FDA indirect food contact

Checkout:
  - Secure payment icons
  - Free shipping threshold
  - Return policy link
  - Customer service phone

About pages:
  - 70+ years in business
  - 4,000+ customers worldwide
  - Industry certifications
```

## Product Description Template

Every product follows this structure:

### [WHAT IT IS]

```
Example (MOCAP):
Round vinyl caps designed for 3/4-inch inside diameter
threaded fittings, tubes, and openings.

Example (Cleartec):
Clear PETG tubes with sealed bottom construction for
retail display and product packaging.

Example (Beckett):
Telescopic protective containers for end mills and cutting
tools with adjustable length from 2" to 6".

Example (X-Treme):

for permanent high-temperature repairs.

One sentence. Product type, primary dimension, key material.
```

### [WHAT IT DOES]

```
Example (MOCAP):
Protects threaded openings from dust, moisture, and
mechanical damage during manufacturing, finishing,
storage, and shipping. Prevents contamination in
hydraulic systems and pneumatic equipment.

Example (Cleartec):
Showcases products with full 360° visibility while
protecting from handling damage. Seals securely with
end caps for retail display or shipping.

Example (Beckett):
Organizes and protects precision cutting tools from
damage during storage and transport. Telescopic design
adjusts to exact tool length, minimizing wasted space.

Example (X-Treme):
Creates permanent waterproof seal that withstands
extreme temperatures (-80°F to 500°F) and pressure
(600 psi). No adhesive means no messy residue.

Function and benefit. What problem does this solve?

# Information Architecture

## Current IA Problems

### The Flat Taxonomy Trap

MOCAP's 85 product series live in flat list:
```
- Caps, Plastic Protective
- Caps, Round Vinyl
- Caps, Tapered Vinyl
- Hole Plugs
- Plugs, Button Style
- Plugs, Pull Tab
- Plugs, Universal
- [... 78 more ...]
```

**Problems:**
- 46 series contain word "Plug"
- 28 series contain word "Cap"
- No clear distinction or hierarchy
- Users must read through entire list
- "Plug" and "Cap" often mean same thing

### The Missing Application Context

Current navigation thinks in product types. Users think in applications.

**Users ask:**
- "What protects threads during powder coating?"
- "What fits a 3/4-inch rod?"
- "What works for outdoor use?"

**Site answers:**
- "Here are 46 types of plugs"
- "Check each product specification"
- "Call us and we'll help you"

Gap between user mental model and IA is why search fails. Taxonomy designed for catalog management, not customer discovery.

### The Brand Confusion

Beckett products appear on Cleartec site. Company name is MOCAP but products on other sites. No unified navigation across brands.

> "Most confusing thing is that the company name is MOCAP, the packaging products are Beckett which can be found on the Cleartec website."

Architecture optimized for operational convenience, not customer understanding.

## Recommended IA Structure

### Multi-Path Framework

No single navigation path serves all users. Build multiple entry points for different mental models:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Path 1: Part Number Search (Veterans - 30%)

**Target user:** Knows exact SKU, needs speed
**Behavior:** Types part number, expects instant match

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│  I KNOW MY PART NUMBER                │
│                                       │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ RVC9044                      🔍 │  │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                       │
│  → Instant result with:               │
│     - Product image                   │
│     - Specifications                  │
│     - Stock status                    │
│     - Pricing (if logged in)          │
│     - Add to Cart button              │
│                                       │
│  → Variant table below                │
│     (if multiple sizes/colors)        │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No navigation chrome. No distractions. Search → Result → Cart.

### Path 2: Application Hierarchy (Problem Solvers - 50%)

**Target user:** Knows what needs protecting, not product names
**Behavior:** Thinks "I need to protect threads during painting"

**Level 1: Primary Applications**
```
Thread Protection
Surface Protection
End Protection
Shipping Protection
```

**Level 2: Use Cases**
```
Thread Protection →
  - Powder Coating
  - Painting
  - Plating/Anodizing
  - Storage/Transit
  - Installation
```

**Level 3: Product Recommendations**
```
Powder Coating →
  Primary: High-temp silicone caps (400°F+)
  Alternative: Tapered vinyl plugs (250°F)
  Related: X-Treme masking tape
```

Each level narrows focus. Educational content explains why certain products fit certain uses.

### Path 3: Product Type Taxonomy (Problem Solvers - 50%)

**Target user:** Knows general category, needs to narrow by specs
**Behavior:** "I need a cap, probably vinyl, for 1/2-inch diameter"

**Level 1: Product Categories**
```
Caps & Plugs
  - Caps, Vinyl (round, tapered, flanged)
  - Caps, Plastic (threaded, snap-on, push-on)

```

**Level 2: Filterable Product Tables**

Land on "Caps, Vinyl" → See interactive table with filters:
- Shape (round, tapered, flanged)
- Size range (ID, OD, length)
- Material (vinyl, silicone, PVC)
- Temperature rating
- Color
- Features (pull tab, flanged, FDA)

### Path 4: Industry/Use Case Pages (Explorers - 20%)

**Target user:** Researching solutions, needs education
**Behavior:** "What do automotive manufacturers use?"

**Landing page structure:**
```

## Accessibility Principles

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance (Minimum)

**Perceivable:**
- Text contrast 4.5:1 minimum (7:1 for AAA targets)
- Images have descriptive alt text
- Video content has captions
- Color not sole indicator (use icons + text)
- Text resizable to 200% without horizontal scroll

**Operable:**
- All functionality keyboard-accessible
- Skip links to main content
- Focus indicators visible
- No keyboard traps
- Sufficient time to complete forms

**Understandable:**
- Clear, simple language (8th grade reading level)
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Input assistance (helpful error messages)
- Forms with clear labels and instructions

**Robust:**
- Valid HTML5 semantic markup
- ARIA labels where native HTML insufficient
- Compatible with screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Responsive design works with zoom/magnification

### Testing Plan
- Automated: aXe, WAVE, Lighthouse
- Manual: Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen readers: Test with JAWS and VoiceOver
- Zoom: Test at 200%, 400% magnification
- Color: Test with color blindness simulation
- User testing: Include users with disabilities

Accessibility isn't checkbox compliance. It's design quality.

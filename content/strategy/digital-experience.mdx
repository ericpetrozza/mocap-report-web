# Digital Experience Strategy & Vision

## UX Strategy Overview

The website must transform from operational burden to revenue driver. Current state forces manual workarounds, creates customer frustration, blocks self-service. New state enables independence, transparency, speed.

This requires simultaneous evolution across four layers:

### Foundation Layer: Fix What's Broken
- Search that returns results
- Data that reflects reality
- Analytics that measure behavior
- Performance that inspires confidence

### Enablement Layer: Build Self-Service
- Portal for order visibility
- Pricing transparency for logged-in users
- Stock visibility for planning
- Carrier accounts for seamless ordering

### Optimization Layer: Reduce Friction
- Interactive tables users can manipulate
- Multi-path navigation for different mental models
- Configurators that guide decisions
- Mobile parity for on-the-go access

### Growth Layer: Drive Value
- Reorder flows for repeat buyers
- Sample requests integrated with purchase
- Educational content for explorers
- Guided discovery for problem solvers

These layers build on each other. Can't optimize friction until self-service works. Can't enable self-service until foundation is fixed.

## The Consolidation Question

Current state: Three separate websites, 31 regional domains, fragmented customer experience.

Three architectural approaches emerged from research:

### Option A: Complete Separation
**Structure:** MOCAP.com, Cleartec.com, Beckett.com remain independent

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Brand clarity preserved | Duplicate development |
| Minimal disruption | Fragmented customer data |
| Independent optimization | No cross-sell |
| | SEO dilution |

**Stakeholder support:** Low. Only 2 of 28 saw this as viable path forward.

### Option B: Full Consolidation
**Structure:** Single MOCAP.com with all brands, unified navigation, shared cart

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Maximum efficiency | Brand dilution risk |
| Unified data | Complex IA |
| Cross-sell enabled | One-size-fits-all UX |
| SEO consolidated | Navigation overload |

**Stakeholder support:** Moderate. 40% favor this approach, especially operations and IT.

### Option C: Hybrid Platform (Recommended)
**Structure:** One technical platform, brand-specific experiences

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Technical efficiency + brand preservation | More complex to design |
| Cross-sell possible | Requires thoughtful IA |
| Flexible optimization | Slightly higher initial dev cost |

**Stakeholder support:** Strong. 58% prefer this once explained, aligns with Apple model.

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Platform

**Technical foundation:** One codebase, one database, one ERP middleware, one analytics property

**Experience layer:** Brand-specific theming, IA, configurators, navigation

### Implementation Options

**Option C1: Brand Subdomains (Recommended)**
```
mocap.domain.com
cleartec.domain.com
beckett.domain.com
xtreme.domain.com
```
Clear brand separation in URL. Shared backend. Cross-brand search optional. SEO benefit from domain authority.

**Option C2: Brand Paths**
```
domain.com/mocap
domain.com/cleartec
domain.com/beckett
domain.com/xtreme
```
Unified domain. Easier cross-brand navigation. Simpler analytics. Stronger SEO consolidation.

### What "Hybrid" Means in Practice

**Shared Infrastructure (Invisible to Users):**
- Single Magento instance
- Unified product database
- Shared customer accounts (optional single login)
- Consolidated ERP middleware
- One GA4 property (with brand filters)
- Shared payment processing
- Unified order management

**Brand-Specific Experience (Visible to Users):**
- Custom theme per brand
- Brand-specific homepage
- Tailored navigation structure
- Custom configurators (Cleartec tubes, Beckett tools)
- Brand voice in copy
- Unique visual design
- Optimized mobile layouts

## Main UX Principles

### 1. Speed Over Perfection

Veterans want speed. They know exactly what they need. Every click is friction.

**Design for:**
- Instant part number match in search
- Skip-the-queue "I Know My Part Number" entry
- One-click reorder from history
- Inline cart actions in tables
- Express checkout with saved payment

**Don't force:**
- Guided wizards on users who don't need them
- Required configurators for known parts
- Multiple page navigation for simple purchases
- Account creation when guest checkout works

### 2. Guide the Uncertain

Problem Solvers and Explorers need guidance. They don't know taxonomy. They think in applications, not product codes.

**Design for:**
- Application-based navigation ("Protect during painting")
- Progressive disclosure in configurators
- Educational content at decision points
- "Not sure? Here's what others like you ordered"
- Visual examples showing use cases

**Don't assume:**
- Users know difference between "cap" and "plug"
- Technical specs are meaningful without context
- Product hierarchy is obvious
- Material properties are understood

### 3. Make Tables Tools, Not Displays

Users interact with tables expecting spreadsheet behavior. Current static tables frustrate this mental model.

**Design for:**
- Sortable columns (any attribute)
- Filterable rows (multi-select)
- Searchable content (instant filter)
- Inline actions (cart, sample, compare)
- Visible row count ("Showing 47 of 185 variants")

**Include:**
- Clear active filter indicators
- Reset filters button
- Column visibility toggle (hide/show attributes)
- Export to CSV option for technical buyers
- Imperial/metric toggle for MOCAP

### 4. Mobile Parity, Zero Compromise

Mobile users are buyers, not just researchers. One-third of traffic. Growing.

**Design for:**
- Touch targets 44px minimum
- Thumb-zone primary actions
- No hover-required interactions
- Vertical scrolling over horizontal
- Progressive disclosure (expand/collapse)

**Test for:**
- Forms completable on phone
- Tables usable on tablet
- Search functional with autocomplete
- Images high-res but fast-loading
- Checkout flow mobile-optimized

### 5. Transparency Builds Trust

Data accuracy crisis eroded trust. Every stock display, price, lead time is now suspect. Users call to verify.

**Rebuild trust through:**
- Real-time stock numbers (not cached)
- Clear warehouse location
- Honest lead times
- "Updated 5 minutes ago" timestamps
- "Call us if you need it sooner" options

**Never show:**
- Stock if ERP sync is stale
- Pricing if it might be wrong
- Delivery estimates if warehouse isn't confirmed
- Vague "available soon" without date

**If data is uncertain, say so:**
- "Stock updating, call for current availability"
- "Custom configuration, contact for quote"
- "Lead time varies, we'll confirm after order"

Honesty > false certainty.

### 6. Progressive Disclosure Reduces Overload

MOCAP catalog has 85 series, ~66,000 variants. Showing everything at once overwhelms.

**Design for:**
- Start broad, narrow progressively
- Show 10-20 results, expand with interaction
- Collapse advanced options initially
- Reveal complexity as needed
- Provide escape hatches ("Start over", "View all")

**Avoid:**
- All filters visible on page load
- 320-variant tables without grouping
- Configuration screens with 12 simultaneous choices
- Mega-menus with every possible option

### 7. Self-Service with Safety Net

Enable independence, but never leave users stranded.

**Design for:**
- Clear "Need help? Call us" presence
- Contextual assistance ("What's this?" tooltips)
- Escape to human ("Talk to specialist")
- Sample options when uncertain
- "Recommended for you" based on behavior

**Never force:**
- Self-service on complex custom orders
- Automated responses when call is better
- Configuration when consultation needed
- Account creation to get assistance

Portal and search enable independence. Phone number provides safety.

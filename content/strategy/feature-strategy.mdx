# Feature Strategy (UX & CRO)

## Prioritization Philosophy

28 stakeholders want 50+ features. Budget and timeline allow 5-7 in MVP. Prioritization must be ruthless and data-driven.

Three factors determine priority:

### 1. Stakeholder Consensus (MoSCoW Data)
- 100% consensus: Customer Portal
- 91% consensus: Search, Pricing
- 80% consensus: Carrier Accounts
- 74% consensus: Stock Visibility

### 2. Foundation Dependencies
- Search enables everything else
- Data accuracy blocks automation
- Portal requires ERP integration
- Tables need database restructure

### 3. Impact Potential
- Search fix: 20-25% sales increase
- Portal: 50%+ CS call reduction
- Data accuracy: 40-50% European order recovery
- Carrier accounts: Unlocks online ordering

Features that score high on all three dimensions are MVP. Features that score high on one or two are Phase 1+.

## Prioritization Matrix

### TIER 1: Critical (MVP Launch Blockers)

These five features represent the non-negotiable foundation. Launch without them creates worse experience than current broken site.

| Feature | Consensus | Why MVP | Quantified Impact |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Customer Portal** | 100% (22/22) | Order status = 50%+ CS calls | 50%+ call reduction, 24/7 self-service |
| **Multi-Mode Smart Search** | 91% (21/23) | Current 100% error rate blocks discovery | 20-25% sales increase, eliminate 15+ calls/rep/day |
| **Real-Time Stock Visibility** | 74% (17/23) | Europe 40-50% cancellations due to bad data | Trust restoration, order accuracy >98% |
| **Logged-In Negotiated Pricing** | 91% (20/22) | Repeat buyers can't see their prices | Unlocks self-service for price-sensitive customers |
| **Customer Carrier Accounts** | 80% (12/15) | Shipping cost barrier to online orders | Removes friction for established accounts |

**Combined Impact:** These five features together address the three universal failures (search, portal, data accuracy) and unlock self-service for established customers.

### TIER 2: High-Value (Phase 1 Strategic)

These features significantly improve experience and drive conversion but aren't launch blockers.

| Feature | Consensus | Why High-Value | Experience Impact |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Interactive Product Tables** | Strong implicit (48-54% clicks) | Users expect spreadsheet behavior | Reduces friction, enables self-directed discovery |
| **Multi-Path Navigation** | Moderate (competitor validation) | Single path fails 70% of users | Problem Solvers and Explorers enabled |

**Strategic Reasoning:** Tables and navigation dramatically improve UX but aren't blocking. Current static tables work (poorly). Portal and search literally don't function.

### TIER 3: Enhancement (Phase 1+ Addition)

Features with strong stakeholder support or clear conversion benefit but buildable after MVP proves foundation.

| Feature | Consensus | Why Later | Value Timing |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bulk Reorder** | 83% (15/18) | Requires portal foundation | Repeat buyer efficiency after portal adoption |
| **Delivery Date Estimates** | 75% (15/20) | Needs accurate lead time data | Trust builder once data accuracy proven |
| **Online Sample Requests** | Polarized (5.0 vs 2.0) | Requires policy decision + abuse controls | Growth driver after sample policy set |
| **Quantity Calculator** | 67% (12/18) | Nice-to-have utility | Reduces calculation errors, not blocking |
| **Product Finder/Wizard** | 56% (14/25) | Duplicates search for some users | Helps Explorers, overlaps with navigation |

### TIER 4: Optimization (Phase 2+)

Features that optimize experience for specific segments or add convenience but low immediate impact.

| Feature | Consensus | Why Phase 2 | Segment Value |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **AI Product Advisor** | Mixed | Technology risk, training needed | Long-term vision, wait for data |
| **Visual Product Preview** | Moderate | Complex for high-variant products | Nice enhancement, not essential |
| **Industry-Specific Pages** | Moderate | Content creation intensive | SEO benefit, build over time |
| **Product Comparison** | Low-Moderate | Limited use case for caps/plugs | Technical buyer tool, niche |
| **Personalization Engine** | Low initial | Requires user behavior data | Optimize after 6+ months data |

**Critical path:**
Data accuracy → ERP integration → Portal → Pricing → Carrier Accounts

Can't build portal without ERP integration. Can't show pricing without portal. Can't enable carrier accounts without checkout.

**Parallel development possible:**
Search and Tables can develop simultaneously with Portal (different data dependencies).

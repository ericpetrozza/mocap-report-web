## Appendix A: Full Theme List

### Recurring Research Themes Across All Files

1. **Self-Service Imperative** (Universal)
   - Portal for order status
   - Search for product discovery
   - Real-time stock visibility
   - Pricing transparency
   - Goal: Eliminate forced customer contact for routine information

2. **Search as Foundation** (68% stakeholder consensus)
   - Current: 100% error rate, 85.7% zero results
   - Required: 6 search modes (part #, dimension, application, material, thread, competitor)
   - Impact: 20-25% sales increase potential
   - Blocker: Broken search prevents all other improvements from working

3. **Data Accuracy Blocker** (64% stakeholder consensus)
   - ERP sync delays: 2 weeks to 3 months
   - Impact: 40-50% European order cancellations
   - Without fix: Can't build features on bad foundation
   - Critical path: Data audit Phase 0, before development

4. **Tables as Interactive Tools** (48-54% of all user clicks)
   - Users expect spreadsheet behavior (sort, filter, search within)
   - Current: Static HTML tables
   - Impact: 11.6% dead clicks, 4.3% rage clicks
   - Required: Sortable columns, filterable rows, inline actions

5. **Multi-Path Navigation** (Competitor validation)
   - Single path fails 70% of users
   - Required: Part number, product type, application, industry
   - Veteran buyers (30%): Part number entry
   - Problem solvers (50%): Application/product browse
   - Explorers (20%): Industry/education content

6. **Mobile Parity Not Afterthought** (27-32% traffic)
   - Current site: Not mobile-friendly
   - Required: Touch-optimized, cards not tables, thumb-zone placement
   - Impact: One-third of potential customers currently underserved

7. **Visual Navigation Dominance** (CrazyEgg evidence)
   - MOCAP: 22-33% clicks on images
   - Cleartec/Beckett: 44-52% clicks on images
   - Left sidebar: Only 5-13% clicks
   - Implication: Image-first navigation, minimize text-only menus

8. **Consolidation with Nuance** (Hybrid approach)
   - For: Unified platform (shared infrastructure, single analytics)
   - Against: Brand-specific audiences and needs
   - Solution: Unified backend, brand-specific theming and experiences

9. **Brand Architecture Indecision Blocking** (Critical)
   - No consensus on unified vs separate brand sites
   - Blocks: IA design, navigation, content strategy, development
   - Must decide: Week 1-2, use data not opinion

10. **Configurator Hesitation** (CrazyEgg: 10-20 second delay)
    - Cleartec users uncertain about dropdown choices
    - Current: All dropdowns at once, no guidance
    - Solution: Step-based wizard, progressive disclosure, "Why this matters" explanations

11. **Sample as First Step** (15 requests/day, first-time buyers ALWAYS request)
    - Critical for new customer acquisition
    - Current: Unclear process, must call/email
    - Required: $0 cart items, limits/policy, sample-to-purchase workflow

12. **Regional Variations Matter** (But not blocking)
    - Europe: 40-50% cancellations (data accuracy crisis)
    - China: Zero online orders (relationship model)
    - Mexico: Cross-border complexity (freight, customs)
    - US: 70 manual orders daily (portal would eliminate)
    - Recommendation: US-first launch, international Phase 2

13. **Three Buyer Archetypes** (Competitor research)
    - Veteran (30%): Knows SKU, needs speed
    - Problem Solver (50%): Knows application, needs guidance
    - Explorer (20%): Researching, needs education
    - Each requires different path

14. **Trust Through Transparency** (Data accuracy crisis eroded trust)
    - Honest stock status (never show if stale)
    - Real-time warehouse location
    - Accurate lead times
    - "Updated 5 minutes ago" timestamps
    - If uncertain, say so

15. **Technical Constraints Real** (Not negotiable)
    - 3 ERPs (Sage Fox Pro 32-bit no API, EFACs cloud XML, KingDee China)
    - 320+ variants per product (platform must support)
    - 4-decimal pricing (eliminates some platforms)
    - 180 size chart column types (data complexity)
    - Analytics completely broken (must rebuild)
